## Problem Statement: Master Plan

At **hu3agency: We're All Right**, we publish frameworks for creative people who are curious about developing **parallel** societies. Using platform design, supply chain management, ecosystem marketing, and citywide planning, our open source frameworks enable anyone to identify and transform the humanity's problems into tangible products that redesign our institutions to be more free, open source, and non-authoritarian.

### What problem does hu3agency think needs to be solved?

hu3agency's problem can be described in four layers:
1. The human ego is extremely good at identifying and treating symptoms, but doesn't invest in understanding the true source of problems
2. [The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/about-the-project/) supplies ongoing research exploring the source of humanity's problems (The Metacrisis), but isn't focused on value added frameworks to implement solutions
3. hu3agency: We're All Right focuses on creating value added frameworks to implment solutions, but our limited perspective can never represent an acurate solution for civilization
4. [ourStory: Everything Is Music](https://github.com/ourStoryNetwork) enables anyone to use hu3agency's frameworks to develop their own solution for civilization, but we need people who are commited to sharing their perspective

To simplify all of this, let's combine #1 and #2 in a simple problem statemet for hu3agency: Human Ego Causes Humanity's Metacrisis. How can we make this more tangible?

### Human Ego Causes Humanity's Metacrisis

We think that Humanity's challenges (The Metacrisis) as a larger projection of the challenges every person faces in their in their day to day life (The Ego). To explore this, we're using the following platform model that relates the human ego to humanity's metacrisis:

Platform Model | Human Ego | Humanity's Metacrisis  
--- | --- | :--- 
OWNER      | Spirit | Investment Chains 
PRODUCER   | Soul   | Supply Chains 
CONSUMER   | Body   | Value Chains 
PROVIDER   | Mind   | Civil Chains 

hu3agency's framework models the human ego as as a disconnection from spirit, soul, body, and mind. We then translate this into a **parallel** model at the collective level to model Humanity's metacrisis as corruption of our investment, supply, value, and civil chains.

Let's dive into each **parallel** mental models below.

### Spirit : Human :: Investment Chains : Humanity
Spirit is to a human as investment chains are to humanity. 

hu3agency's model explores investment chains as projections of the human spirit. The problem is that humans are disconnected from spirit. This disconnection manifests itself on a societal scale with an investment chain that incentivizes destructive and corrupt behavior in centralized institutions.

### Soul : Human :: Supply Chains : Humanity
Soul is to a human as supply chains are to humanity.

If we think of supply chains as large scale models of the human soul, then the problem is that humans are disconnected from soul. We see the shifts in climate as a symptom of the deeper problem: farmers -- the source of our civilization's progress -- are the stewards of the planet, but have all of their autonomy stripped away with supply chains that are unsustainable and centralized.

### Body : Human :: Value Chains : Humanity
Body is to a human as value chains are to humanity.

hu3agency models value chains as an reflection of the human body. This presents a challenge when many are disconnected from the body. As a result, value chains are aligned with corrupt regulations that marginalize the companies that make up the largest part of humanity's workforce, Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs), further centralizing power to historically corrupt corporations. 

### Mind : Human :: Civil Chains : Humanity
Mind is the a human as civil chains are to humanity.

The communities we live in are an outward projection of humanity's collective mind. If our cities are a projection of our collective minds, and mental health is a growing problem, then the fact that civil chains (citywide planning) are overwhelmingly controlled by corrupt institutions with little to no input from individuals, we're at risk of creating cities that perpetuate our problems instead of solving them.

### What is missing?

This is our perspective of what's causing humanity's problems. After taking the time to draw parallels between the human ego and humanity's metacrisis, what do we think is missing?

The Planet

Humanity is disconnected from the human processes , and humans arehave lost their connection to the planetary processes that produced us. Can we use The Planet as a process to solve for ego and the metacrisis at the same time?
