# Introduction
## Problem Statement

At **hu3agency: We're All Right**, we publish frameworks for people interested in creating **parallel** societies. Using platform design, supply chain management, ecosystem marketing, and civil engineering, our frameworks enable anyone to transform humanity's problems into platforms that redesign our institutions to be more free and open source. 

### What problem does hu3agency think needs to be solved?

hu3agency's problem can be described in four layers:
1. The human ego is more invested in treating symptoms than understanding the underlying causes to humanity's problems
2. [The Consilience Project](https://consilienceproject.org/about-the-project/) explores the underlying causes of humanity's problems (The Metacrisis), but doesn't offer frameworks to implement solutions   
3. hu3agency offers frameworks to implement solutions, but since we're just one project, we can only provide a limited perspective on for potential solutions
4. [ourStory: Everything Is Music](https://github.com/ourStoryNetwork) is an open source platform for generating unlimited perspectives based on hu3agency a "civil media" game that enables anyone to use hu3agency's frameworks to develop personalized solutions for civilization, but we need more people who are interested in playing the game

To simplify all of this, let's combine #1 and #2 into a single problem statemet for hu3agency: Human Ego Causes Humanity's Metacrisis.

### Human Ego Causes Humanity's Metacrisis

We think that Humanity's challenges (The Metacrisis) as a larger projection of the challenges individuals faces in their in their day to day lives (The Ego). To explore this, we're using the following platform model that relates the human ego to humanity's metacrisis:

Platform Model | Human Ego | Humanity's Metacrisis  
--- | --- | :--- 
OWNER      | Spirit | Investment Chains 
PRODUCER   | Soul   | Supply Chains 
CONSUMER   | Body   | Value Chains 
PROVIDER   | Mind   | Civil Chains 

hu3agency's frameworks discuss the human ego as as a disconnection from spirit, soul, body, and mind. Then, we translate this into a **parallel** model to represent Humanity's metacrisis as corruption of our investment, supply, value, and civil chains.

Let's dive into each of the **parallel** mental models below.

### Spirit : Human :: Investment Chains : Humanity
Spirit is to a human as investment chains are to humanity. 

hu3agency's model explores investment chains as projections of the human spirit. The problem is that humans are disconnected from spirit. This disconnection manifests itself on a societal scale with an investment chain that incentivizes destructive and corrupt behavior in centralized institutions.

### Soul : Human :: Supply Chains : Humanity
Soul is to a human as supply chains are to humanity.

If we think of supply chains as large scale models of the human soul, then the problem is that humans are disconnected from soul. We see the shifts in climate as a symptom of the deeper problem: farmers -- the source of our civilization's progress -- are the stewards of the planet, but have all of their autonomy stripped away with supply chains that are unsustainable and centralized.

### Body : Human :: Value Chains : Humanity
Body is to a human as value chains are to humanity.

hu3agency models value chains as an reflection of the human body. This presents a challenge when many are disconnected from the body. As a result, value chains are aligned with corrupt regulations that marginalize the companies that make up the largest part of humanity's workforce, Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs), further centralizing power to historically corrupt corporations. 

### Mind : Human :: Civil Chains : Humanity
Mind is the a human as civil chains are to humanity.

The communities we live in are an outward projection of humanity's collective mind. If our cities are a projection of our collective minds, and mental health is a growing problem, then the fact that civil chains (citywide planning) are overwhelmingly controlled by corrupt institutions with little to no input from individuals, we're at risk of creating cities that perpetuate our problems instead of solving them.

### What are these models missing?

This is our perspective of what's causing humanity's problems. After taking the time to draw parallels between the human ego and humanity's metacrisis, what do we think is missing from our current model?
