## Problem Statement

hu3agency's p3cosystem Master Plan stemps from a concept defined by The Consilience Project: The Metacrisis.

> At no other point in history has humanity faced such a wide range of novel catastrophic risks. Our civilization has never been more vast, complicated, and fragile. This systemic fragility is exacerbated by new technologies, geopolitical instability, an ecological crisis and a reliance on global economic supply chains. These interlocking, interrelated problems are known collectively as the metacrisis. The Consilience Project’s primary aim is to clarify and reveal the nature of the metacrisis to enable comprehensive solutions to global problems. Our work recognizes the interconnectedness of humanity’s challenges: any solution must factor the underlying drivers of each one.

hu3agency's primary aim is to translate the research of the Consilience Project surrounding the metacrisis into Parallel Permaculture Platforms Ecosystems (p3cosystems) that enable anyone to create comprehensive solutions that aim to identify and address the root causes of the metacrisis. 

### What does hu3agency believe is the root cause of the metacrisis?

We believe it's easy to get caught up in the chaotic surface level problems that we're inundated with every day, but working on any of them without strong sense of the root cause is a waste of time. At hu3agency, the singularity of the metacrisis is ego. 

When we say ego, we're referring to Eckhart Tolle's definition of an individual being overly identified with their self image to the point that they're blind to how they're connected to other people, The Planet, and the Universe itself. Additionally, let's think of ego as being overly focused on "left-brained" analytical thinking and neglecting "right-brained" creative thinking.

### What are the primary problems created from ego?

We see the collective challenges that humanity faces as larger projections of what every person is faces in their own way. Because of this, we'll be exploring ego at an individual scale using creative concepts so we can develop more analytical concepts at the collective scale.

On an individual level, we believe unconscious ego shows itself as a disconnection from spirit, soul, body, and mind. At the collective level, we believe unconscious ego manifests as corruption in humanity's institutions, supply chains, value chains, and a new term that we call "civil chains," respectively.

Platform | Individual | Humanity  
--- | --- | :--- 
OWNER      | Spirit | Institutions 
PRODUCER   | Soul   | Supply Chains 
CONSUMER   | Body   | Value Chains 
PROVIDER   | Mind   | Civil Chains 

We'll explore each problem below.

### How does hu3agency define the Spirit/ Institution problem?

Individuals being disconnected from spirit manifests itself on a societal scale as corrupt institutions that are more invested in accepting money from lobbyists that give them more power regardless of the destructive consequences. While many people can admit institutions are corrup, we invest an overwhelming amount of time and energy in "us vs. them" dynamics without addressing the underlying corruption that supports both "sides" of any issue. 

### How does hu3agency define the Soul/ Supply Chain problem?

When people are disconnected from the soul, it shows up collectively as smallholder farmers being disconnected from sustainable supply chains. Currently, farmers are overly dependent on centralized supply chains that take away the autonomy over the raw materials that are the source of every civilizations prosperity.

### How does hu3agency define the Body/ Value Chain problem?

Continuing from soul, the body represents value chains. Ego-driven disconnection manifests as Small & Medium Enterprises being excluded by corrupt regulations. We aim to break down these barriers, ensuring fair and inclusive participation in profitable value chains.

### How does hu3agency define the Mind/ Civil Chain problem?

The abstract challenge of disconnection from the creative structures that shape our civilization, i.e., cities, is addressed through the mind or citywide planning, known as the "civil chain." Disconnection manifests as limited opportunities for individuals and families to influence the inaccessible civil chains shaping their future. Our objective is to empower communities to actively shape the spaces defining their lives.
