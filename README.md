## Problem Statement: Master Plan
### ep0_daoTeaching

hu3agency publishes frameworks for people who want to create self-soverign communities using best practices from platform design, supply chain management, ecosystem marketing, and citywide planning. Our frameworks enable anyone to identify the key challenges facing humanity and transform them into open source experiments that explore how our social systems and institutions can be redesigned to ensure free, open, non-authoritarian sociaties can thrive.

### What does hu3agency believe is the root cause of the metacrisis?

At no other point in history has humanity faced such a wide range of novel catastrophic risks. Our civilization has never been more vast, complicated, and fragile. This systemic fragility is exacerbated by new technologies, geopolitical instability, an ecological crisis and a reliance on global economic supply chains. These interlocking, interrelated problems are known collectively as the metacrisis. The Consilience Project’s primary aim is to clarify and reveal the nature of the metacrisis to enable comprehensive solutions to global problems. Our work recognizes the interconnectedness of humanity’s challenges: any solution must factor the underlying drivers of each one.

We believe it's easy to get caught up in the chaotic surface level problems that we're inundated with every day, but working on any of them without strong sense of the root cause is a waste of time. At hu3agency, the singularity of the metacrisis is ego. 

When we say ego, we're referring to Eckhart Tolle's definition of an individual being overly identified with their self image to the point that they're blind to how they're connected to other people, The Planet, and the Universe itself. Additionally, let's think of ego as being overly focused on "left-brained" analytical thinking and neglecting "right-brained" creative thinking.

### What are the primary problems created from ego?

We see the collective challenges that humanity faces as larger projections of what every person is faces in their own way. Because of this, we'll be exploring ego at an individual scale using creative concepts so we can develop more analytical concepts at the collective scale.

On an individual level, we believe unconscious ego shows itself as a disconnection from spirit, soul, body, and mind. At the collective level, we believe unconscious ego manifests as corruption in humanity's institutions, supply chains, value chains, and a new term that we call "civil chains," respectively.

Platform | Individual | Humanity  
--- | --- | :--- 
OWNER      | Spirit | Institutions 
PRODUCER   | Soul   | Supply Chains 
CONSUMER   | Body   | Value Chains 
PROVIDER   | Mind   | Civil Chains 

We'll explore each problem below.

### Spirit : Human :: Investment Chains : Humanity

Spirit is to a human as investment chains are to humanity. 

hu3agency's model explores investment chains as projections of the human spirit. The problem is that humans are disconnected from spirit. This disconnection manifests itself on a societal scale with an investment chain that incentivizes destructive and corrupt behavior in centralized institutions.

### Soul : Human :: Supply Chains : Humanity

Soul is to a human as supply chains are to humanity.

If we think of supply chains as large scale models of the human soul, then the problem is that humans are disconnected from soul. We see the shifts in climate as a symptom of the deeper problem: farmers -- the source of our civilization's energy -- are the stewards of the planet, but have all of their autonomy stripped away with unsustainable supply chains.

### Body : Human :: Value Chains : Humanity

Body is to a human as value chains are to humanity.

hu3agency models value chains as an reflection of the human body. This presents a challenge when many are disconnected from the body. As a result, value chains are aligned with corrupt regulations that marginalize the companies that make up the largest part of humanity's workforce, Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs), further centralizing power to historically corrupt corporations. 

### Mind : Human :: Civil Chains : Humanity

Mind is the a human as civil chains are to humanity.

The communities we live in are an outward projection of humanity's collective mind. If our cities are a projection of our collective minds, and mental health is a growing problem, then the fact that civil chains (citywide planning) are overwhelmingly controlled by corrupt institutions with little to no input from individuals, we're at risk of creating cities that perpetuate our problems instead of solving them.

### What is missing?

This is one attempt at summarizing the problems facing society. The problem is that we either have think tanks that talk about this at length, or traditional companies that are only interested in a narrow view of the problem. 

After taking the time to draw parallels between a human and humanity, what do we think is missing?

The Planet

Next, we'll present the permaculture process that transforms these parallel relationships into a platform ecosystem.
